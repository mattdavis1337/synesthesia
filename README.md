# Synesthesia

The simple plan for Synesthesia Alpha is to have a colorful game grid that appears on everybody's screen in the same way with any web browser.  

Once we have a "massively multiplayer" colorful game grid on the web, we can add some interactions that appear on everybody's screen as they happen. A click could change a color, or make ripples of color, that appear on other screens as they happen.  

Then we have a collaborative game board/pallete and this will be our engine.

From there we can create different domains or spaces with the color propagation engine and implement different games. MMO Snake game comes to mind.  Memory games are possible.   I want to do some casino style games with cards and tokens eventually.  

For now we're getting the plumbing down - we want a real-time collaborative game/pallete engine on the web.  We'll burn a copy and share it open source when we get there.  Enjoy! 


#TODO

Use this free Bootstrap theme with Brunch to make Synesthesia responsive and cross-browser functional - https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/creative/

Add user login/logout and user profile functionality - Planning to use Contexts guide from https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/contexts.html#adding-account-functions for this functionality

Learn testing with this stack and give the rest of us a good TDD guide (ugh we should do this first right?)




To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
